MINI Remastered -- Mini Is Not IOS

MINI Remastered is an updated fork of a bare-bones 
replacement for IOS.  It does not have all of the features 
that IOS provides. Notably, we have not yet implemented USB, 
networking, write support to the NAND filesystem, DI support or 
WC24 support.  However, all hardware is directly accessable via IPC --
see mini_ipc.c/h for details.

Please feel free to add or write code to fill in gaps in the
functionality.  As it stands, it's useful for low-level system
recovery tasks, and as a shim/proxy to allow code on the PPC
(e.g. Linux) to have full access to the Wii's hardware.

We hope to implement these changes ASAP. Using code from Wii-Linux 
(specifically Archii) we can make a fully fuctional replacment to the 
IOS with a GUI that is both user friendly and useful.
